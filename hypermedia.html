    <h1>What is HyperText</h1>
    <h3>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</h3>
    <h3>Hypertext is text which contains <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Terms.html#link">links </a>to other texts. The term was coined by <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Xanadu.html#Nelson"> Ted Nelson</a>around 1965 (see <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/History.html"> History )</a> ).</h3>
<h3>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Talks/YesWeCan.snd"> sound </a> , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</h3>
